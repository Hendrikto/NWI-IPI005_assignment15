Assume we have 4 zones: zone0..zone3.
Assume we have two cars: car0 and car1, both wanting to turn left.
The following happens:

1. car0 blocks zone0
2. car2 block zone2
3. car0 blocks zone1
4. car2 block zone3
5. car0 waits for zone2 to be released
5. car2 waits for zone0 to be released

As you can see we now have two cars both waiting on each other so nothing happens anymore. This is called a deadlock.
